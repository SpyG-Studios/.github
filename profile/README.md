An organization dedicated to developing modern Bukkit plugins for Minecraft server owners, providing innovative and effective alternatives. We are a team of developers who are passionate about creating plugins that are easy to use, reliable, and efficient. Our goal is to provide server owners with the tools they need to create a unique and enjoyable experience for their players.

## Our GitHub

We have created this GitHub organization to publish the source code of our plugins allowing **anyone** to contribute, report bugs and more. Unfortunately, our premium, paid plugins are not available here.
